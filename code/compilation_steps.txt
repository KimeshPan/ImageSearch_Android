Read the README file for understanding the system requirements and the dependencies

Steps to compile:

1. Navigate to code directory
2. A Makefile is provided with the code, type in terminal 'make datasets'
This should compile generate the datset and populate with images
3. For running training for tensorflow model, change the no. of iterations you want to train for in tensorFacenet.py
4. Then type in terminal 'make tensor_run'. This should run the tensorflow model for training, status will be displayed after iterations as mentioned in tensorFacenet.py
5. After training it will automatically run the Test set with accuracy
6. Now to Freeze and optimize the graph for inference type 'make freeze'
7. Now type in 'make android_port' to generate copy the model in the 'My Application' Android project.
8. Open the Android Studio and compile the project. After that you can port the APK file generated to your device.
9. Before running port the 'tester' directory to '/storage/emulated/0/DCIM/'. This will provide it with dataset to run inference 
10. Note it might crash on first attempt due to requirement for permissions for access device storage. Try again and it should work.
11. There could be lot of lag in the app as each change in the Activity results into re-inferncing all the images which could take about 2-5 sec.
